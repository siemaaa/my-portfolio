      <p>Hi! I'm Siema, a rising junior at Macaulay in City College. I want to make more accessible systems!
        I come from immigrant parents, so I grew up feeling that a lot of things, especially technology, were not
        made with them in mind. Accessibility to me means breaking down barriers and making products that are easy 
        for everyone to use. Technology can do so much for the world, so everyone should have an equitable chance
        to understand and enjoy it. My parents read, wrote, and spoke Bengali, but it is not a common enough language
        to be included in base translations. To build on that, I believe what makes me who I am is that I have an internal
        duty to make sure everyone feels welcome. This Earth is for everyone! 
      </p>
